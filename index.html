        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>This website is a personal website which is a repository of some of my writings, reflections and activities.</p>
        <p>Long-form reflective essays (and also, sometimes, shorter thoughts playing in my mind) are found on the <a href="reflections.html">Reflections</a> page. The <a href="academics.html">Academics</a> page will contain links to my academic writing and other academic materials. The <a href="climbing.html">Climbing</a> page has trip notes for various hikes and climbs. The <a href=""curious.html">Curiousities</a> page is mainly dedicated towards acknowledging that I learn a lot from parenting. This has many forms, but to give an illustration of what this page is geared towards: my daughter often asks something which she is curious about (<em>"If light can travel through a vacuum, why can't sound?"</em>), and that makes me search for the best way to explain something. I thought a collection of question and answers such as these may be of some interest to children and to parents of young children more generally as well. </p>
        <p>On the footer of each page, you will find some quotes which resonate with me, or which give me food for thought. Refresh the page for a new quote! I hope you relish them too.</p>

                return data.split('\n').filter(quote => quote.trim() !== '');

                    const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length);
                    const randomQuote = quotes[randomIndex];
