        <h3>Setting Course!</h3>
        <p>I am grateful to what legal practice has done for me - for instance, I am in a position where I can choose to stop worrying about money.</p> 
        <p>But the potential for freedom is not the same as actually having the freedom. Practice involves time wastage in court, it involves having to play status games, and it involves dealing with client demands and related stresses. I detest all these things. I do not find joy or meaning in legal work any more. I enjoy the law as an academic subject, but not simply as a vocation for scoring points over others. I think that the intellectual joys in practice are not sufficient to compensate for the immense waste of time and overall stress and the growing feeling of not being in alignment with oneself.</p><p>Money was what kept me going, but there must be a point when a life spent just making money is not a life lived well. And I think that I am at that point now.</p>
        <p>I am happy to choose to take back control. To live in my terms. To do something because I genuinely want to do it.</p>
        <p>And here is what I want to do:</p>
            <p>• <em>Spend quality time with my daughter, be as good a parent as I can be.</em> This one doesn’t really require any explanation, does it?</p>
            <p>• <em>Train seriously for alpinism.</em> Not for any end result, but because the process and the discipline itself is what gives me fulfilment. Climbing gives me joy. Training gives me discipline and focus.</p>
            <p>• <em>Do something which pushes me intellectually.</em> An intellectual challenge. But I need to decide what exactly... Occasional teaching, perhaps? Resuming chess seriously? Learning something completely new? So many options - but there's also plenty of time to live mindfully and savour life, rather than rush through it...</p>
