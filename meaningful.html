      <h3>What constitutes a meaningful life?</h3>
      <p>
        Living a meaningful life sounds like a worthy goal; but until we can
        begin to understand what 'meaning' entails, the goal is too abstract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps, it is best to start with an acknowledgment that the quest for
        'meaning' is personal journey. What may be meaningful for one person may
        be entirely without meaning for another. So the real question is: what
        would be a life full of meaning <em>for me</em>?
      </p>
      <p>
        One could begin by elimination, by first identifying that which is not
        meaningful. I can list the pursuit of money solely for the sake of money
        as being at the head of that list. No doubt, money is important so far
        as it enables one to have a base to start thinking about larger
        questions. Without a stable financial base (at least to the extent of
        meeting daily needs), questions of 'meaning' are premature at best and
        meaningless at worst. But once that basic threshold is crossed, the
        pursuit of money does not seem meaningful any more. Another item on the
        list is the pursuit of 'status games'. I find no great purpose of
        meaning in appearing successful, or in appearing to the world to be 'at
        the top of the game'. If one participates in status games, it would seem
        that one is constrained to participate in a game where the rules are set
        by others, whether those rules align with one's own self or not. A third
        item on this list would be this: the pursuit of activity for the sake of
        activity, to show to the world how one is 'busy'. Being busy is, at the
        highest, a morally neutral state: there is no inherent virtue in being
        busy. Being busy, in itself, does not add any meaning to life. And being
        busy to show other people that one is busy is in fact a detriment.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shows that the pursuit of a career in tax litigation is certainly
        not the way to a meaningful life for me. Yes, it pays: but that does not
        add anything to finding meaning. And tax litigation - any type of career
        in the practice of law, really - does involve plenty of status games.
        And while being busy is not a virtue, the practice of law entails
        showing that one is busy (perhaps this point is related to the point
        about status games) without actually adding much value. The sheer
        wastage of time spent waiting for Courts and clients simply has no
        compensatory value attached to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So then, what would constitute 'meaning'? I think that a meaningful life
        must mean a life spent maximising one's time in the zone of conscious
        choice: where one does things because one wants to do them, and not
        simply because one has to. A meaningful life is a life where one is in
        control of one's time. Where one has the choice to decide how to spend
        time. Each day, every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        And what does one do with that time? In my view, that is not so
        important - the fact that one is in control of one's time is itself the
        key to meaning. Once that is the case, everything one does is in itself
        meaningful. It is likely that in such a situation, one might spend
        (within the zone of conscious choice) some time at leisure, and some
        time in trying to push the frontiers of one's abilities in any field of
        human endeavour. It might be that a leisure activity itself involves
        participating in actions of pushing oneself in a given field. The choice
        of the field itself does not seem to matter much; what gives life
        meaning is not the field one is in, but the ability to be in control of
        one's time together with the ability to consciously choose to be or not
        be in the given field. This freedom is the key to a meaningful life.
      </p>
      <p>
        One objection to this analysis appears - is this just an excuse to being
        lazy? If this attitude is adopted to meaning, then does that mean one
        should just spend time in frivolity and not undertake any challenging
        undertaking? After all, why would one want to do something hard at all
        in life; and if one does nothing hard in life, can it be a meaningful
        life? In response to this, I would say that the issue hinges on freedom
        and the zone of conscious choice. If one consciously chooses to
        participate in leisure only, that is still meaningful enough. But
        speaking for myself (and I have already highlighted that the quest for
        meaning is a personal one), I would balance leisure together with doing
        something productive. This 'productive' aspect could be seen in the
        sense of enhancing the 'good' around me by producing something valuable
        to the world around me, and could also be seen from a more internal
        perspective - by trying to push the limits of what I personally think I
        am capable of. And what is also important to acknowledge is that one can
        choose to work hard despite not feeling like working at a given time -
        that does not detract from freedom, because the choice of working hard
        is also my choice. And I know that if I am working on something which I
        feel does add value, then the thoughts of
        <em>"oh I don't want to do this right now"</em> can be battled by me
      </p>
      <p>
        So, in short, a meaningful life is a life of freedom, where one is in a
        position to control one's time. And I would choose to use that time
        consciously, in pushing myself to exploring the frontiers of my
        abilities.
