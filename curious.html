        <h2>Curiosities!</h2>
        <p>This page is mainly dedicated towards the curious spirits of young children, and towards recognising that parents learn a lot because of their children! This page is essentially made of small tidbits on various subjects which my daughter may ask me about (or which I may was to explain about), and which I try to see how best I can explain to a curious youngster. Topics will be added on an on-going basis, distributed across various subjects. This is a good way to practice the <a href="https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/">Feynman Technique</a> too... And thanks to <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a>, which provides plenty of answers to a plenty of things!</p>

    <!--Collapsible question answer-->
    
        <button class="collapsible">If light can travel through a vacuum, why can't sound? <span class="arrow">▼</span></button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The movement of light and sound 'waves' (and I leave aside the point, for now, that 'light' can be seen as 'particles' instead of 'waves)' fundamentally differs. Light, being an electromagnetic wave, consists of electric and magnetic fields that can self-propagate through a vacuum. This is because photons, the quantum particles of light, do not require a medium for transmission: they are their own medium. On the other hand, sound is a mechanical wave (caused by the oscillation of particles of other matter: sound itself is nothing) that necessitates a physical medium for propagation. It travels by creating compressions and rarefactions in the particles of the medium, whether gas, liquid, or solid. In a vacuum, the absence of particles precludes the transfer of these mechanical vibrations, rendering sound transmission impossible. If there is no matter, there are no sound waves possible because sound is basically a wave of other matter! This distinction underscores the fundamental difference between electromagnetic and mechanical waves, illustrating why electromagnetic radiation can traverse the vast emptiness of space while sound remains confined to environments with matter present.]</p>

        <button class="collapsible">How do chameleons change colour? <span class="arrow">▼</span></button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Chameleons can change color thanks to special skin cells called chromatophores. These cells have different colors of pigments, like red, yellow, and blue. When a chameleon wants to change color, it can make these cells bigger or smaller, mixing the colors underneath to create new ones. They also have tiny crystals in their skin that can change how light reflects off them, which helps them show even more colors. Chameleons change color for several reasons: to stay warm, to talk to other chameleons (like showing off or warning others), and sometimes to blend in with their surroundings to hide from predators.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">Why do soap bubbles pop? <span class="arrow">▼</span></button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Soap bubbles pop because they are made of a thin layer of soap and water that forms a film. This film is very delicate, and when something disturbs it—like a sharp object, a breeze, or even the oils from your fingers—the bubble can break. The air inside the bubble wants to escape, and when the film is too weak to hold it in, the bubble bursts. Additionally, bubbles can pop if they dry out, because the water in the soap film evaporates, making it too thin to stay intact.</p>
            <p>A more detailed answer is this: Soap bubbles pop because they are made of a thin layer of soap and water that forms a film. This film is very delicate, and when something disturbs it—like a sharp object, a breeze, or even the oils from your fingers—the bubble can break. The air inside the bubble wants to escape, and when the film is too weak to hold it in, the bubble bursts. Additionally, bubbles can pop if they dry out, because the water in the soap film evaporates, making it too thin to stay intact. So, every time you see a bubble, remember it's like a tiny, fragile balloon filled with air!</p>

        <button class="collapsible">How are mountains formed? <span class="arrow">▼</span></button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Mountains are formed mainly through a process called tectonic activity, which involves the movement of the Earth's plates. Imagine the Earth’s surface is like a giant puzzle made up of huge pieces called tectonic plates. Sometimes, these plates push against each other, and when they collide, they can force the land upwards, creating mountains. This can happen over millions of years! There are also other ways mountains can form, like volcanic activity, where magma from inside the Earth erupts and builds up around the volcano, forming a mountain. So, whether it's from plates pushing together or lava cooling down, mountains are nature's way of showing how powerful the Earth can be!.</p>

        <button class="collapsible">Why does western Maharashtra get more rain than eastern Maharashtra? <span class="arrow">▼</span></button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Western Maharashtra gets more rain than Eastern Maharashtra mainly because of the Western Ghats, a mountain range that runs along the coast. When the moist winds from the Arabian Sea hit these mountains, they are pushed upwards, cool down, and turn into rain. This is why places on the western side of the Ghats, like the Konkan region, receive a lot of rainfall, sometimes over 2,000 mm a year! On the other hand, Eastern Maharashtra is in a rain shadow area, meaning that by the time the winds come down from the mountains, they are dry and don’t bring much rain. As a result, parts of Eastern Maharashtra can get less than 600 mm of rain a year, making it much drier.</p>
